Users will go on the website and choose between two options based on who they are going out with. (Buttons: “Family-Friendly” or “Friends Friendly”)
Based on their selection in step 1, they will be provided with the top 3 restaurant options and top 3 events taking place in the city/country they select from the drop down menue, whether it’s “Family-Friendly" or "Friends-Friendly".
